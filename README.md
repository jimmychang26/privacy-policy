# DCAvg Privacy-Policy
We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal health data.

Data Access Our app integrates with Apple Health using the HealthKit framework to read certain health-related data, such as steps count and walking distance. This data is read directly from your device to provide personalized features within the app.

Data Usage The health data accessed is used solely for display within the app and is processed locally on your device. We do not store or transmit this data to our servers or any external parties.

Data Sharing We do not share any HealthKit or CareKit data with third parties. Your data remains private and only accessible on your device.

User Control You have full control over what health data the app can access. You can change the permissions or revoke access at any time by going to your device’s settings and modifying the HealthKit permissions.

Data Security Although we do not store your health data, we take your privacy seriously and ensure that all health data read from HealthKit is handled securely within the app.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy practices, feel free to contact us at dcavgapp@gmail.com.
